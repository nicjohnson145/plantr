  "body": "# 0.41.2\r\n\r\nThis is a patch release which fixes some regressions from 0.41 and general bugs that happened to be fixed along the way. Some dependencies were also vendored (or had a vendored toggle added) to facilitate packaging.\r\n\r\nA notable addition is that plugins now have access to a `/cache` folder which maps to an entry unique to their loaded URL in the Zellij cache folder.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix(input): keypresses not being identified properly with kitty keyboard protocol in some terminals (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3725)\r\n* fix(input): reapply ctrl-j fix for the new architecture\r\n* fix(plugins): various cwd and usability fixes for the plugin manager (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3749)\r\n* fix(output-buffer): handle race that sometimes caused text spillover (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3750)\r\n* fix(tabs): some event ordering issues exposed by the recent runtime change (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3758)\r\n* fix(plugins): do not duplicate built-in plugins, eg. session-manager (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3759)\r\n* fix(terminal): reset kitty keyboard support when resetting terminal state (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3760)\r\n* fix(startup): crash when unable to watch config dir (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3761)\r\n* fix(startup): slow start in some cases due to a race in the server retry queue (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3767)\r\n* fix(screen): various crashes due to invalid state exposed by the recent wasm runtime change (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3776)\r\n* chore(package): add the option to use the system curl instead of the vendored version when compiling (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3766)\r\n* fix(ux): change plugin manager \"open from filesystem\" shortcut for consistency with the session-manager (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3779)\r\n* fix(plugins): send `PaneClosed` event to plugins also when an entire tab was closed (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3781)\r\n* feat(plugins): add a `/cache` folder to plugins to persist data between runs (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3787)\r\n* feat(package): vendor the common_path dependency (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3780)\r\n* fix(plugins): derive `Hash` and `Ord` for PaneIds (https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/pull/3790)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do you like Zellij ❤️ ?\r\n\r\nMe too!
